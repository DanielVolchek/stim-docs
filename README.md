# Documentation Files

This directory contains a variety of different documentation files (it will) from API specifications to high level overviews of architecture and more

The best way to open the documentation is by importing it as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. 
If done correctly (there is a guide inside the docs) this will allow you to quickly navigate between relevant files, natively view and modify excalidraw files, and keep your changes up to date with VSC

If that doesn't work for you there will be a web version linked here in the future with limited functionality

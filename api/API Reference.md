NOTE: If this file is not correctly rendering a full list of APIs, please ensure [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) is correctly installed and enabled. The easiest way to do this is by trusting the vault and enabling its plugins. This will also give you access to correctly viewing the embedded excalidraw [[highlevel.excalidraw|architecture]] 

```dataview
TABLE file.route from #api 
```

```dataviewjs
dv.pages('#api')
```
